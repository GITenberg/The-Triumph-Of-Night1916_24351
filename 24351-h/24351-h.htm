    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was clear that the sleigh from Weymore had not come; and the shivering
      young traveller from Boston, who had counted on jumping into it when he
      left the train at Northridge Junction, found himself standing alone on the
      open platform, exposed to the full assault of night-fall and winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blast that swept him came off New Hampshire snow-fields and ice-hung
      forests. It seemed to have traversed interminable leagues of frozen
      silence, filling them with the same cold roar and sharpening its edge
      against the same bitter black-and-white landscape. Dark, searching and
      sword-like, it alternately muffled and harried its victim, like a
      bull-fighter now whirling his cloak and now planting his darts. This
      analogy brought home to the young man the fact that he himself had no
      cloak, and that the overcoat in which he had faced the relatively
      temperate air of Boston seemed no thicker than a sheet of paper on the
      bleak heights of Northridge. George Faxon said to himself that the place
      was uncommonly well-named. It clung to an exposed ledge over the valley
      from which the train had lifted him, and the wind combed it with teeth of
      steel that he seemed actually to hear scraping against the wooden sides of
      the station. Other building there was none: the village lay far down the
      road, and thither&mdash;since the Weymore sleigh had not come&mdash;Faxon
      saw himself under the necessity of plodding through several feet of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood well enough what had happened: his hostess had forgotten
      that he was coming. Young as Faxon was, this sad lucidity of soul had been
      acquired as the result of long experience, and he knew that the visitors
      who can least afford to hire a carriage are almost always those whom their
      hosts forget to send for. Yet to say that Mrs. Culme had forgotten him was
      too crude a way of putting it Similar incidents led him to think that she
      had probably told her maid to tell the butler to telephone the coachman to
      tell one of the grooms (if no one else needed him) to drive over to
      Northridge to fetch the new secretary; but on a night like this, what
      groom who respected his rights would fail to forget the order?
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon&rsquo;s obvious course was to struggle through the drifts to the village,
      and there rout out a sleigh to convey him to Weymore; but what if, on his
      arrival at Mrs. Culme&rsquo;s, no one remembered to ask him what this devotion
      to duty had cost? That, again, was one of the contingencies he had
      expensively learned to look out for, and the perspicacity so acquired told
      him it would be cheaper to spend the night at the Northridge inn, and
      advise Mrs. Culme of his presence there by telephone. He had reached this
      decision, and was about to entrust his luggage to a vague man with a
      lantern, when his hopes were raised by the sound of bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two sleighs were just dashing up to the station, and from the foremost
      there sprang a young man muffled in furs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weymore?&mdash;No, these are not the Weymore sleighs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was that of the youth who had jumped to the platform&mdash;a
      voice so agreeable that, in spite of the words, it fell consolingly on
      Faxon&rsquo;s ears. At the same moment the wandering station-lantern, casting a
      transient light on the speaker, showed his features to be in the
      pleasantest harmony with his voice. He was very fair and very young&mdash;hardly
      in the twenties, Faxon thought&mdash;but his face, though full of a
      morning freshness, was a trifle too thin and fine-drawn, as though a vivid
      spirit contended in him with a strain of physical weakness. Faxon was
      perhaps the quicker to notice such delicacies of balance because his own
      temperament hung on lightly quivering nerves, which yet, as he believed,
      would never quite swing him beyond a normal sensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You expected a sleigh from Weymore?&rdquo; the newcomer continued, standing
      beside Faxon like a slender column of fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Culme&rsquo;s secretary explained his difficulty, and the other brushed it
      aside with a contemptuous &ldquo;Oh, <i>Mrs. Culme!</i>&rdquo; that carried both
      speakers a long way toward reciprocal understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then you must be&mdash;&rdquo; The youth broke off with a smile of
      interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new secretary? Yes. But apparently there are no notes to be answered
      this evening.&rdquo; Faxon&rsquo;s laugh deepened the sense of solidarity which had so
      promptly established itself between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend laughed also. &ldquo;Mrs. Culme,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;was lunching at my
      uncle&rsquo;s to-day, and she said you were due this evening. But seven hours is
      a long time for Mrs. Culme to remember anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Faxon philosophically, &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s one of the reasons
      why she needs a secretary. And I&rsquo;ve always the inn at Northridge,&rdquo; he
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you haven&rsquo;t, though! It burned down last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce it did!&rdquo; said Faxon; but the humour of the situation struck him
      before its inconvenience. His life, for years past, had been mainly a
      succession of resigned adaptations, and he had learned, before dealing
      practically with his embarrassments, to extract from most of them a small
      tribute of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s sure to be somebody in the place who can put me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one <i>you</i> could put up with. Besides, Northridge is three miles
      off, and our place&mdash;in the opposite direction&mdash;is a little
      nearer.&rdquo; Through the darkness, Faxon saw his friend sketch a gesture of
      self-introduction. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Frank Rainer, and I&rsquo;m staying with my uncle
      at Overdale. I&rsquo;ve driven over to meet two friends of his, who are due in a
      few minutes from New York. If you don&rsquo;t mind waiting till they arrive I&rsquo;m
      sure Overdale can do you better than Northridge. We&rsquo;re only down from town
      for a few days, but the house is always ready for a lot of people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your uncle&mdash;?&rdquo; Faxon could only object, with the odd sense,
      through his embarrassment, that it would be magically dispelled by his
      invisible friend&rsquo;s next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my uncle&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see! I answer for <i>him!</i> I daresay you&rsquo;ve
      heard of him&mdash;John Lavington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Lavington! There was a certain irony in asking if one had heard of
      John Lavington! Even from a post of observation as obscure as that of Mrs.
      Culme&rsquo;s secretary the rumour of John Lavington&rsquo;s money, of his pictures,
      his politics, his charities and his hospitality, was as difficult to
      escape as the roar of a cataract in a mountain solitude. It might almost
      have been said that the one place in which one would not have expected to
      come upon him was in just such a solitude as now surrounded the speakers&mdash;at
      least in this deepest hour of its desertedness. But it was just like
      Lavington&rsquo;s brilliant ubiquity to put one in the wrong even there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve heard of your uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>will</i> come, won&rsquo;t you? We&rsquo;ve only five minutes to wait.&rdquo;
       young Rainer urged, in the tone that dispels scruples by ignoring them;
      and Faxon found himself accepting the invitation as simply as it was
      offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A delay in the arrival of the New York train lengthened their five minutes
      to fifteen; and as they paced the icy platform Faxon began to see why it
      had seemed the most natural thing in the world to accede to his new
      acquaintance&rsquo;s suggestion. It was because Frank Rainer was one of the
      privileged beings who simplify human intercourse by the atmosphere of
      confidence and good humour they diffuse. He produced this effect, Faxon
      noted, by the exercise of no gift but his youth, and of no art but his
      sincerity; and these qualities were revealed in a smile of such sweetness
      that Faxon felt, as never before, what Nature can achieve when she deigns
      to match the face with the mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned that the young man was the ward, and the only nephew, of John
      Lavington, with whom he had made his home since the death of his mother,
      the great man&rsquo;s sister. Mr. Lavington, Rainer said, had been &ldquo;a regular
      brick&rdquo; to him&mdash;&ldquo;But then he is to every one, you know&rdquo;&mdash;and the
      young fellow&rsquo;s situation seemed in fact to be perfectly in keeping with
      his person. Apparently the only shade that had ever rested on him was cast
      by the physical weakness which Faxon had already detected. Young Rainer
      had been threatened with tuberculosis, and the disease was so far advanced
      that, according to the highest authorities, banishment to Arizona or New
      Mexico was inevitable. &ldquo;But luckily my uncle didn&rsquo;t pack me off, as most
      people would have done, without getting another opinion. Whose? Oh, an
      awfully clever chap, a young doctor with a lot of new ideas, who simply
      laughed at my being sent away, and said I&rsquo;d do perfectly well in New York
      if I didn&rsquo;t dine out too much, and if I dashed off occasionally to
      Northridge for a little fresh air. So it&rsquo;s really my uncle&rsquo;s doing that
      I&rsquo;m not in exile&mdash;and I feel no end better since the new chap told me
      I needn&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo; Young Rainer went on to confess that he was extremely
      fond of dining out, dancing and similar distractions; and Faxon, listening
      to him, was inclined to think that the physician who had refused to cut
      him off altogether from these pleasures was probably a better psychologist
      than his seniors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same you ought to be careful, you know.&rdquo; The sense of
      elder-brotherly concern that forced the words from Faxon made him, as he
      spoke, slip his arm through Frank Rainer &lsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter met the movement with a responsive pressure. &ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i>:
      awfully, awfully. And then my uncle has such an eye on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if your uncle has such an eye on you, what does he say to your
      swallowing knives out here in this Siberian wild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rainer raised his fur collar with a careless gesture. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that that
      does it&mdash;the cold&rsquo;s good for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not the dinners and dances? What is it, then?&rdquo; Faxon
      good-humouredly insisted; to which his companion answered with a laugh:
      &ldquo;Well, my uncle says it&rsquo;s being bored; and I rather think he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His laugh ended in a spasm of coughing and a struggle for breath that made
      Faxon, still holding his arm, guide him hastily into the shelter of the
      fireless waiting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Rainer had dropped down on the bench against the wall and pulled off
      one of his fur gloves to grope for a handkerchief. He tossed aside his cap
      and drew the handkerchief across his forehead, which was intensely white,
      and beaded with moisture, though his face retained a healthy glow. But
      Faxon&rsquo;s gaze remained fastened to the hand he had uncovered: it was so
      long, so colourless, so wasted, so much older than the brow he passed it
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer&mdash;a healthy face but dying hands,&rdquo; the secretary mused: he
      somehow wished young Rainer had kept on his glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whistle of the express drew the young men to their feet, and the next
      moment two heavily-furred gentlemen had descended to the platform and were
      breasting the rigour of the night. Frank Rainer introduced them as Mr.
      Grisben and Mr. Balch, and Faxon, while their luggage was being lifted
      into the second sleigh, discerned them, by the roving lantern-gleam, to be
      an elderly greyheaded pair, of the average prosperous business cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saluted their host&rsquo;s nephew with friendly familiarity, and Mr.
      Grisben, who seemed the spokesman of the two, ended his greeting with a
      genial&mdash;&ldquo;and many many more of them, dear boy!&rdquo; which suggested to
      Faxon that their arrival coincided with an anniversary. But he could not
      press the enquiry, for the seat allotted him was at the coachman&rsquo;s side,
      while Frank Rainer joined his uncle&rsquo;s guests inside the sleigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift flight (behind such horses as one could be sure of John
      Lavington&rsquo;s having) brought them to tall gateposts, an illuminated lodge,
      and an avenue on which the snow had been levelled to the smoothness of
      marble. At the end of the avenue the long house loomed up, its principal
      bulk dark, but one wing sending out a ray of welcome; and the next moment
      Faxon was receiving a violent impression of warmth and light, of hot-house
      plants, hurrying servants, a vast spectacular oak hall like a
      stage-setting, and, in its unreal middle distance, a small figure,
      correctly dressed, conventionally featured, and utterly unlike his rather
      florid conception of the great John Lavington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise of the contrast remained with him through his hurried
      dressing in the large luxurious bedroom to which he had been shown. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t see where he comes in,&rdquo; was the only way he could put it, so
      difficult was it to fit the exuberance of Lavington&rsquo;s public personality
      into his host&rsquo;s contracted frame and manner. Mr. Laving ton, to whom
      Faxon&rsquo;s case had been rapidly explained by young Rainer, had welcomed him
      with a sort of dry and stilted cordiality that exactly matched his narrow
      face, his stiff hand, and the whiff of scent on his evening handkerchief.
      &ldquo;Make yourself at home&mdash;at home!&rdquo; he had repeated, in a tone that
      suggested, on his own part, a complete inability to perform the feat he
      urged on his visitor. &ldquo;Any friend of Frank&rsquo;s... delighted... make yourself
      thoroughly at home!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of the balmy temperature and complicated conveniences of Faxon&rsquo;s
      bedroom, the injunction was not easy to obey. It was wonderful luck to
      have found a night&rsquo;s shelter under the opulent roof of Overdale, and he
      tasted the physical satisfaction to the full. But the place, for all its
      ingenuities of comfort, was oddly cold and unwelcoming. He couldn&rsquo;t have
      said why, and could only suppose that Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s intense personality&mdash;intensely
      negative, but intense all the same&mdash;must, in some occult way, have
      penetrated every corner of his dwelling. Perhaps, though, it was merely
      that Faxon himself was tired and hungry, more deeply chilled than he had
      known till he came in from the cold, and unutterably sick of all strange
      houses, and of the prospect of perpetually treading other people&rsquo;s stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not famished?&rdquo; Rainer&rsquo;s slim figure was in the doorway. &ldquo;My
      uncle has a little business to attend to with Mr. Grisben, and we don&rsquo;t
      dine for half an hour. Shall I fetch you, or can you find your way down?
      Come straight to the dining-room&mdash;the second door on the left of the
      long gallery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared, leaving a ray of warmth behind him, and Faxon, relieved,
      lit a cigarette and sat down by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking about with less haste, he was struck by a detail that had escaped
      him. The room was full of flowers&mdash;a mere &ldquo;bachelor&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; in the
      wing of a house opened only for a few days, in the dead middle of a New
      Hampshire winter! Flowers were everywhere, not in senseless profusion, but
      placed with the same conscious art that he had remarked in the grouping of
      the blossoming shrubs in the hall. A vase of arums stood on the
      writing-table, a cluster of strange-hued carnations on the stand at his
      elbow, and from bowls of glass and porcelain clumps of freesia-bulbs
      diffused their melting fragrance. The fact implied acres of glass&mdash;but
      that was the least interesting part of it. The flowers themselves, their
      quality, selection and arrangement, attested on some one&rsquo;s part&mdash;and
      on whose but John Lavington&rsquo;s?&mdash;a solicitous and sensitive passion
      for that particular form of beauty. Well, it simply made the man, as he
      had appeared to Faxon, all the harder to understand!
    </p>
    <p>
      The half-hour elapsed, and Faxon, rejoicing at the prospect of food, set
      out to make his way to the dining-room. He had not noticed the direction
      he had followed in going to his room, and was puzzled, when he left it, to
      find that two staircases, of apparently equal importance, invited him. He
      chose the one to his right, and reached, at its foot, a long gallery such
      as Rainer had described. The gallery was empty, the doors down its length
      were closed; but Rainer had said: &ldquo;The second to the left,&rdquo; and Faxon,
      after pausing for some chance enlightenment which did not come, laid his
      hand on the second knob to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room he entered was square, with dusky picture-hung walls. In its
      centre, about a table lit by veiled lamps, he fancied Mr. Lavington and
      his guests to be already seated at dinner; then he perceived that the
      table was covered not with viands but with papers, and that he had
      blundered into what seemed to be his host&rsquo;s study. As he paused Frank
      Rainer looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s Mr. Faxon. Why not ask him&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington, from the end of the table, reflected his nephew&rsquo;s smile in
      a glance of impartial benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Come in, Mr. Faxon. If you won&rsquo;t think it a liberty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grisben, who sat opposite his host, turned his head toward the door.
      &ldquo;Of course Mr. Faxon&rsquo;s an American citizen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank Rainer laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!... Oh, no, not one of your
      pin-pointed pens, Uncle Jack! Haven&rsquo;t you got a quill somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Balch, who spoke slowly and as if reluctantly, in a muffled voice of
      which there seemed to be very little left, raised his hand to say: &ldquo;One
      moment: you acknowledge this to be&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My last will and testament?&rdquo; Rainer&rsquo;s laugh redoubled. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t
      answer for the &lsquo;last.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the first, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere formula,&rdquo; Mr. Balch explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here goes.&rdquo; Rainer dipped his quill in the inkstand his uncle had
      pushed in his direction, and dashed a gallant signature across the
      document.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon, understanding what was expected of him, and conjecturing that the
      young man was signing his will on the attainment of his majority, had
      placed himself behind Mr. Grisben, and stood awaiting his turn to affix
      his name to the instrument. Rainer, having signed, was about to push the
      paper across the table to Mr. Balch; but the latter, again raising his
      hand, said in his sad imprisoned voice: &ldquo;The seal&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, does there have to be a seal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon, looking over Mr. Grisben at John Lavington, saw a faint frown
      between his impassive eyes. &ldquo;Really, Frank!&rdquo; He seemed, Faxon thought,
      slightly irritated by his nephew&rsquo;s frivolity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got a seal?&rdquo; Frank Rainer continued, glancing about the table.
      &ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be one here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grisben interposed. &ldquo;A wafer will do. Lavington, you have a wafer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington had recovered his serenity. &ldquo;There must be some in one of
      the drawers. But I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I don&rsquo;t know where my secretary keeps
      these things. He ought to have seen to it that a wafer was sent with the
      document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it&mdash;&rdquo; Frank Rainer pushed the paper aside: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hand
      of God&mdash;and I&rsquo;m as hungry as a wolf. Let&rsquo;s dine first, Uncle Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve a seal upstairs,&rdquo; said Faxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington sent him a barely perceptible smile. &ldquo;So sorry to give you
      the trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t send him after it now. Let&rsquo;s wait till after dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington continued to smile on <i>his</i> guest, and the latter, as
      if under the faint coercion of the smile, turned from the room and ran
      upstairs. Having taken the seal from his writing-case he came down again,
      and once more opened the door of the study. No one was speaking when he
      entered&mdash;they were evidently awaiting his return with the mute
      impatience of hunger, and he put the seal in Rainer&rsquo;s reach, and stood
      watching while Mr. Grisben struck a match and held it to one of the
      candles flanking the inkstand. As the wax descended on the paper Faxon
      remarked again the strange emaciation, the premature physical weariness,
      of the hand that held it: he wondered if Mr. Lavington had ever noticed
      his nephew&rsquo;s hand, and if it were not poignantly visible to him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this thought in his mind, Faxon raised his eyes to look at Mr.
      Lavington. The great man&rsquo;s gaze rested on Frank Rainer with an expression
      of untroubled benevolence; and at the same instant Faxon&rsquo;s attention was
      attracted by the presence in the room of another person, who must have
      joined the group while he was upstairs searching for the seal. The
      new-comer was a man of about Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s age and figure, who stood
      just behind his chair, and who, at the moment when Faxon first saw him,
      was gazing at young Rainer with an equal intensity of attention. The
      likeness between the two men&mdash;perhaps increased by the fact that the
      hooded lamps on the table left the figure behind the chair in shadow&mdash;struck
      Faxon the more because of the contrast in their expression. John
      Lavington, during his nephew&rsquo;s clumsy attempt to drop the wax and apply
      the seal, continued to fasten on him a look of half-amused affection;
      while the man behind the chair, so oddly reduplicating the lines of his
      features and figure, turned on the boy a face of pale hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression was so startling that Faxon forgot what was going on about
      him. He was just dimly aware of young Rainer&rsquo;s exclaiming; &ldquo;Your turn, Mr.
      Grisben!&rdquo; of Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s protesting: &ldquo;No&mdash;no; Mr. Faxon first,&rdquo; and
      of the pen&rsquo;s being thereupon transferred to his own hand. He received it
      with a deadly sense of being unable to move, or even to understand what
      was expected of him, till he became conscious of Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s paternally
      pointing out the precise spot on which he was to leave his autograph. The
      effort to fix his attention and steady his hand prolonged the process of
      signing, and when he stood up&mdash;a strange weight of fatigue on all his
      limbs&mdash;the figure behind Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s chair was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon felt an immediate sense of relief. It was puzzling that the man&rsquo;s
      exit should have been so rapid and noiseless, but the door behind Mr.
      Lavington was screened by a tapestry hanging, and Faxon concluded that the
      unknown looker-on had merely had to raise it to pass out. At any rate he
      was gone, and with his withdrawal the strange weight was lifted. Young
      Rainer was lighting a cigarette, Mr. Balch inscribing his name at the foot
      of the document, Mr. Lavington&mdash;his eyes no longer on his nephew&mdash;examining
      a strange white-winged orchid in the vase at his elbow. Every thing
      suddenly seemed to have grown natural and simple again, and Faxon found
      himself responding with a smile to the affable gesture with which his host
      declared: &ldquo;And now, Mr. Faxon, we&rsquo;ll dine.&rdquo;

      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how I blundered into the wrong room just now; I thought you told
      me to take the second door to the left,&rdquo; Faxon said to Frank Rainer as
      they followed the older men down the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did; but I probably forgot to tell you which staircase to take.
      Coming from your bedroom, I ought to have said the fourth door to the
      right. It&rsquo;s a puzzling house, because my uncle keeps adding to it from
      year to year. He built this room last summer for his modern pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Rainer, pausing to open another door, touched an electric button
      which sent a circle of light about the walls of a long room hung with
      canvases of the French impressionist school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon advanced, attracted by a shimmering Monet, but Rainer laid a hand on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He bought that last week. But come along&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you all this
      after dinner. Or <i>he</i> will, rather&mdash;he loves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he really love things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rainer stared, clearly perplexed at the question. &ldquo;Rather! Flowers and
      pictures especially! Haven&rsquo;t you noticed the flowers? I suppose you think
      his manner&rsquo;s cold; it seems so at first; but he&rsquo;s really awfully keen
      about things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon looked quickly at the speaker. &ldquo;Has your uncle a brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother? No&mdash;never had. He and my mother were the only ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or any relation who&mdash;who looks like him? Who might be mistaken for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I ever heard of. Does he remind you of some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer. We&rsquo;ll ask him if he&rsquo;s got a double. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But another picture had arrested Faxon, and some minutes elapsed before he
      and his young host reached the dining-room. It was a large room, with the
      same conventionally handsome furniture and delicately grouped flowers; and
      Faxon&rsquo;s first glance showed him that only three men were seated about the
      dining-table. The man who had stood behind Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s chair was not
      present, and no seat awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young men entered, Mr. Grisben was speaking, and his host, who
      faced the door, sat looking down at his untouched soup-plate and turning
      the spoon about in his small dry hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty late to call them rumours&mdash;they were devilish close to
      facts when we left town this morning,&rdquo; Mr. Grisben was saying, with an
      unexpected incisiveness of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington laid down his spoon and smiled interrogatively. &ldquo;Oh, facts&mdash;what
      <i>are</i> facts? Just the way a thing happens to look at a given
      minute....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard anything from town?&rdquo; Mr. Grisben persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a syllable. So you see.... Balch, a little more of that <i>petite
      marmite</i>. Mr. Faxon... between Frank and Mr. Grisben, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner progressed through a series of complicated courses,
      ceremoniously dispensed by a prelatical butler attended by three tall
      footmen, and it was evident that Mr. Lavington took a certain satisfaction
      in the pageant. That, Faxon reflected, was probably the joint in his
      armour&mdash;that and the flowers. He had changed the subject&mdash;not
      abruptly but firmly&mdash;when the young men entered, but Faxon perceived
      that it still possessed the thoughts of the two elderly visitors, and Mr.
      Balch presently observed, in a voice that seemed to come from the last
      survivor down a mine-shaft: &ldquo;If it <i>does</i> come, it will be the
      biggest crash since &lsquo;93.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington looked bored but polite. &ldquo;Wall Street can stand crashes
      better than it could then. It&rsquo;s got a robuster constitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of constitutions,&rdquo; Mr. Grisben intervened: &ldquo;Frank, are you
      taking care of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush rose to young Rainer&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course! Isn&rsquo;t that what I&rsquo;m here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here about three days in the month, aren&rsquo;t you? And the rest of
      the time it&rsquo;s crowded restaurants and hot ballrooms in town. I thought you
      were to be shipped off to New Mexico?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got a new man who says that&rsquo;s rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t look as if your new man were right,&rdquo; said Mr. Grisben
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon saw the lad&rsquo;s colour fade, and the rings of shadow deepen under his
      gay eyes. At the same moment his uncle turned to him with a renewed
      intensity of attention. There was such solicitude in Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s gaze
      that it seemed almost to fling a shield between his nephew and Mr.
      Grisben&rsquo;s tactless scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think Frank&rsquo;s a good deal better,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;this new doctor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler, coming up, bent to whisper a word in his ear, and the
      communication caused a sudden change in Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s expression. His
      face was naturally so colourless that it seemed not so much to pale as to
      fade, to dwindle and recede into something blurred and blotted-out. He
      half rose, sat down again and sent a rigid smile about the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you excuse me? The telephone. Peters, go on with the dinner.&rdquo; With
      small precise steps he walked out of the door which one of the footmen had
      thrown open.
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary silence fell on the group; then Mr. Grisben once more
      addressed himself to Rainer. &ldquo;You ought to have gone, my boy; you ought to
      have gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The anxious look returned to the youth&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;My uncle doesn&rsquo;t think so,
      really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a baby, to be always governed by your uncle&rsquo;s opinion. You
      came of age to-day, didn&rsquo;t you? Your uncle spoils you.... that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
      the matter....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thrust evidently went home, for Rainer laughed and looked down with a
      slight accession of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the doctor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use your common sense, Frank! You had to try twenty doctors to find one
      to tell you what you wanted to be told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of apprehension overshadowed Rainer&rsquo;, gaiety. &ldquo;Oh, come&mdash;I
      say!... What would <i>you</i> do?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack up and jump on the first train.&rdquo; Mr. Grisben leaned forward and laid
      his hand kindly on the young man&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look here: my nephew Jim Grisben
      is out there ranching on a big scale. He&rsquo;ll take you in and be glad to
      have you. You say your new doctor thinks it won&rsquo;t do you any good; but he
      doesn&rsquo;t pretend to say it will do you harm, does he? Well, then&mdash;give
      it a trial. It&rsquo;ll take you out of hot theatres and night restaurants,
      anyhow.... And all the rest of it.... Eh, Balch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Mr. Balch hollowly. &ldquo;Go <i>at once</i>,&rdquo; he added, as if a
      closer look at the youth&rsquo;s face had impressed on him the need of backing
      up his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Rainer had turned ashy-pale. He tried to stiffen his mouth into a
      smile. &ldquo;Do I look as bad as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grisben was helping himself to terrapin. &ldquo;You look like the day after
      an earthquake,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrapin had encircled the table, and been deliberately enjoyed by Mr.
      Lavington&rsquo;s three visitors (Rainer, Faxon noticed, left his plate
      untouched) before the door was thrown open to re-admit their host. Mr.
      Lavington advanced with an air of recovered composure. He seated himself,
      picked up his napkin and consulted the gold-monogrammed menu. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t
      bring back the filet.... Some terrapin; yes....&rdquo; He looked affably about
      the table. &ldquo;Sorry to have deserted you, but the storm has played the deuce
      with the wires, and I had to wait a long time before I could get a good
      connection. It must be blowing up for a blizzard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jack,&rdquo; young Rainer broke out, &ldquo;Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s been lecturing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington was helping himself to terrapin. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks I ought to have given New Mexico a show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want him to go straight out to my nephew at Santa Paz and stay there
      till his next birthday.&rdquo; Mr. Lavington signed to the butler to hand the
      terrapin to Mr. Grisben, who, as he took a second helping, addressed
      himself again to Rainer. &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s in New York now, and going back the day
      after tomorrow in Olyphant&rsquo;s private car. I&rsquo;ll ask Olyphant to squeeze you
      in if you&rsquo;ll go. And when you&rsquo;ve been out there a week or two, in the
      saddle all day and sleeping nine hours a night, I suspect you won&rsquo;t think
      much of the doctor who prescribed New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon spoke up, he knew not why. &ldquo;I was out there once: it&rsquo;s a splendid
      life. I saw a fellow&mdash;oh, a really <i>bad</i> case&mdash;who&rsquo;d been
      simply made over by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>does</i> sound jolly,&rdquo; Rainer laughed, a sudden eagerness in his
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle looked at him gently. &ldquo;Perhaps Grisben&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s an
      opportunity&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon glanced up with a start: the figure dimly perceived in the study was
      now more visibly and tangibly planted behind Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Frank: you see your uncle approves. And the trip out there
      with Olyphant isn&rsquo;t a thing to be missed. So drop a few dozen dinners and
      be at the Grand Central the day after tomorrow at five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s pleasant grey eye sought corroboration of his host, and
      Faxon, in a cold anguish of suspense, continued to watch him as he turned
      his glance on Mr. Lavington. One could not look at Lavington without
      seeing the presence at his back, and it was clear that, the next minute,
      some change in Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s expression must give his watcher a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s expression did not change: the gaze he fixed on his host
      remained unperturbed, and the clue he gave was the startling one of not
      seeming to see the other figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon&rsquo;s first impulse was to look away, to look anywhere else, to resort
      again to the champagne glass the watchful butler had already brimmed; but
      some fatal attraction, at war in him with an overwhelming physical
      resistance, held his eyes upon the spot they feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure was still standing, more distinctly, and therefore more
      resemblingly, at Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s back; and while the latter continued to
      gaze affectionately at his nephew, his counterpart, as before, fixed young
      Rainer with eyes of deadly menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon, with what felt like an actual wrench of the muscles, dragged his
      own eyes from the sight to scan the other countenances about the table;
      but not one revealed the least consciousness of what he saw, and a sense
      of mortal isolation sank upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth considering, certainly&mdash;&rdquo; he heard Mr. Lavington
      continue; and as Rainer&rsquo;s face lit up, the face behind his uncle&rsquo;s chair
      seemed to gather into its look all the fierce weariness of old unsatisfied
      hates. That was the thing that, as the minutes laboured by, Faxon was
      becoming most conscious of. The watcher behind the chair was no longer
      merely malevolent: he had grown suddenly, unutterably tired. His hatred
      seemed to well up out of the very depths of balked effort and thwarted
      hopes, and the fact made him more pitiable, and yet more dire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon&rsquo;s look reverted to Mr. Lavington, as if to surprise in him a
      corresponding change. At first none was visible: his pinched smile was
      screwed to his blank face like a gas-light to a white-washed wall. Then
      the fixity of the smile became ominous: Faxon saw that its wearer was
      afraid to let it go. It was evident that Mr. Lavington was unutterably
      tired too, and the discovery sent a colder current through Faxon&rsquo;s veins.
      Looking down at his untouched plate, he caught the soliciting twinkle of
      the champagne glass; but the sight of the wine turned him sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go into the details presently,&rdquo; he heard Mr. Lavington say,
      still on the question of his nephew&rsquo;s future. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a cigar first.
      No&mdash;not here, Peters.&rdquo; He turned his smile on Faxon. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve had
      coffee I want to show you my pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, Uncle Jack&mdash;Mr. Faxon wants to know if you&rsquo;ve got a
      double?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A double?&rdquo; Mr. Lavington, still smiling, continued to address himself to
      his guest. &ldquo;Not that I know of. Have you seen one, Mr. Faxon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon thought: &ldquo;My God, if I look up now they&rsquo;ll <i>both</i> be looking at
      me!&rdquo; To avoid raising his eyes he made as though to lift the glass to his
      lips; but his hand sank inert, and he looked up. Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s glance
      was politely bent on him, but with a loosening of the strain about his
      heart he saw that the figure behind the chair still kept its gaze on
      Rainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ve seen my double, Mr. Faxon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Would the other face turn if he said yes? Faxon felt a dryness in his
      throat. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah? It&rsquo;s possible I&rsquo;ve a dozen. I believe I&rsquo;m extremely usual-looking,&rdquo;
       Mr. Lavington went on conversationally; and still the other face watched
      Rainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was... a mistake... a confusion of memory....&rdquo; Faxon heard himself
      stammer. Mr. Lavington pushed back his chair, and as he did so Mr. Grisben
      suddenly leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lavington! What have we been thinking of? We haven&rsquo;t drunk Frank&rsquo;s
      health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lavington reseated himself. &ldquo;My dear boy!... Peters, another
      bottle....&rdquo; He turned to his nephew. &ldquo;After such a sin of omission I don&rsquo;t
      presume to propose the toast myself... but Frank knows.... Go ahead,
      Grisben!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shone on his uncle. &ldquo;No, no, Uncle Jack! Mr. Grisben won&rsquo;t mind.
      Nobody but <i>you</i>&mdash;to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler was replenishing the glasses. He filled Mr. Lavington&rsquo;s last,
      and Mr. Lavington put out his small hand to raise it.... As he did so,
      Faxon looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;All the good I&rsquo;ve wished you in all the past years.... I
      put it into the prayer that the coming ones may be healthy and happy and
      many... and <i>many</i>, dear boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon saw the hands about him reach out for their glasses. Automatically,
      he reached for his. His eyes were still on the table, and he repeated to
      himself with a trembling vehemence: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look up! I won&rsquo;t.... I
      won&rsquo;t....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fingers clasped the glass and raised it to the level of his lips. He
      saw the other hands making the same motion. He heard Mr. Grisben&rsquo;s genial
      &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; and Mr. Batch&rsquo;s hollow echo. He said to himself, as the rim
      of the glass touched his lips: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look up! I swear I won&rsquo;t!&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glass was so full that it required an extraordinary effort to hold it
      there, brimming and suspended, during the awful interval before he could
      trust his hand to lower it again, untouched, to the table. It was this
      merciful preoccupation which saved him, kept him from crying out, from
      losing his hold, from slipping down into the bottomless blackness that
      gaped for him. As long as the problem of the glass engaged him he felt
      able to keep his seat, manage his muscles, fit unnoticeably into the
      group; but as the glass touched the table his last link with safety
      snapped. He stood up and dashed out of the room.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the gallery, the instinct of self-preservation helped him to turn back
      and sign to young Rainer not to follow. He stammered out something about a
      touch of dizziness, and joining them presently; and the boy nodded
      sympathetically and drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs Faxon ran against a servant. &ldquo;I should like to
      telephone to Weymore,&rdquo; he said with dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, sir; wires all down. We&rsquo;ve been trying the last hour to get New
      York again for Mr. Lavington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon shot on to his room, burst into it, and bolted the door. The
      lamplight lay on furniture, flowers, books; in the ashes a log still
      glimmered. He dropped down on the sofa and hid his face. The room was
      profoundly silent, the whole house was still: nothing about him gave a
      hint of what was going on, darkly and dumbly, in the room he had flown
      from, and with the covering of his eyes oblivion and reassurance seemed to
      fall on him. But they fell for a moment only; then his lids opened again
      to the monstrous vision. There it was, stamped on his pupils, a part of
      him forever, an indelible horror burnt into his body and brain. But why
      into his&mdash;just his? Why had he alone been chosen to see what he had
      seen? What business was it of <i>his</i>, in God&rsquo;s name? Any one of the
      others, thus enlightened, might have exposed the horror and defeated it;
      but <i>he</i>, the one weaponless and defenceless spectator, the one whom
      none of the others would believe or understand if he attempted to reveal
      what he knew&mdash;<i>he</i> alone had been singled out as the victim of
      this dreadful initiation!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he sat up, listening: he had heard a step on the stairs. Some
      one, no doubt, was coming to see how he was&mdash;to urge him, if he felt
      better, to go down and join the smokers. Cautiously he opened his door;
      yes, it was young Rainer&rsquo;s step. Faxon looked down the passage, remembered
      the other stairway and darted to it. All he wanted was to get out of the
      house. Not another instant would he breathe its abominable air! What
      business was it of <i>his</i>, in God&rsquo;s name?
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the opposite end of the lower gallery, and beyond it saw the
      hall by which he had entered. It was empty, and on a long table he
      recognized his coat and cap. He got into his coat, unbolted the door, and
      plunged into the purifying night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The darkness was deep, and the cold so intense that for an instant it
      stopped his breathing. Then he perceived that only a thin snow was
      falling, and resolutely he set his face for flight. The trees along the
      avenue marked his way as he hastened with long strides over the beaten
      snow. Gradually, while he walked, the tumult in his brain subsided. The
      impulse to fly still drove him forward, but he began feel that he was
      flying from a terror of his own creating, and that the most urgent reason
      for escape was the need of hiding his state, of shunning other eyes till
      he should regain his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spent the long hours in the train in fruitless broodings on a
      discouraging situation, and he remembered how his bitterness had turned to
      exasperation when he found that the Weymore sleigh was not awaiting him.
      It was absurd, of course; but, though he had joked with Rainer over Mrs.
      Culme&rsquo;s forgetfulness, to confess it had cost a pang. That was what his
      rootless life had brought him to: for lack of a personal stake in things
      his sensibility was at the mercy of such trifles.... Yes; that, and the
      cold and fatigue, the absence of hope and the haunting sense of starved
      aptitudes, all these had brought him to the perilous verge over which,
      once or twice before, his terrified brain had hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why else, in the name of any imaginable logic, human or devilish, should
      he, a stranger, be singled out for this experience? What could it mean to
      him, how was he related to it, what bearing had it on his case?... Unless,
      indeed, it was just because he was a stranger&mdash;a stranger everywhere&mdash;because
      he had no personal life, no warm screen of private egotisms to shield him
      from exposure, that he had developed this abnormal sensitiveness to the
      vicissitudes of others. The thought pulled him up with a shudder. No! Such
      a fate was too abominable; all that was strong and sound in him rejected
      it. A thousand times better regard himself as ill, disorganized, deluded,
      than as the predestined victim of such warnings!
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the gates and paused before the darkened lodge. The wind had
      risen and was sweeping the snow into his race. The cold had him in its
      grasp again, and he stood uncertain. Should he put his sanity to the test
      and go back? He turned and looked down the dark drive to the house. A
      single ray shone through the trees, evoking a picture of the lights, the
      flowers, the faces grouped about that fatal room. He turned and plunged
      out into the road....
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that, about a mile from Overdale, the coachman had pointed
      out the road to Northridge; and he began to walk in that direction. Once
      in the road he had the gale in his face, and the wet snow on his moustache
      and eye-lashes instantly hardened to ice. The same ice seemed to be
      driving a million blades into his throat and lungs, but he pushed on, the
      vision of the warm room pursuing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow in the road was deep and uneven. He stumbled across ruts and sank
      into drifts, and the wind drove against him like a granite cliff. Now and
      then he stopped, gasping, as if an invisible hand had tightened an iron
      band about his body; then he started again, stiffening himself against the
      stealthy penetration of the cold. The snow continued to descend out of a
      pall of inscrutable darkness, and once or twice he paused, fearing he had
      missed the road to Northridge; but, seeing no sign of a turn, he ploughed
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, feeling sure that he had walked for more than a mile, he halted
      and looked back. The act of turning brought immediate relief, first
      because it put his back to the wind, and then because, far down the road,
      it showed him the gleam of a lantern. A sleigh was coming&mdash;a sleigh
      that might perhaps give him a lift to the village! Fortified by the hope,
      he began to walk back toward the light. It came forward very slowly, with
      unaccountable sigsags and waverings; and even when he was within a few
      yards of it he could catch no sound of sleigh-bells. Then it paused and
      became stationary by the roadside, as though carried by a pedestrian who
      had stopped, exhausted by the cold. The thought made Faxon hasten on, and
      a moment later he was stooping over a motionless figure huddled against
      the snow-bank. The lantern had dropped from its bearer&rsquo;s hand, and Faxon,
      fearfully raising it, threw its light into the face of Frank Rainer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rainer! What on earth are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled back through his pallour. &ldquo;What are <i>you</i>, I&rsquo;d like to
      know?&rdquo; he retorted; and, scrambling to his feet with a clutch oh Faxon&rsquo;s
      arm, he added gaily: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve run you down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon stood confounded, his heart sinking. The lad&rsquo;s face was grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What madness&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i>. What on earth did you do it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Do what?... Why I.... I was just taking a walk.... I often walk at
      night....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frank Rainer burst into a laugh. &ldquo;On such nights? Then you hadn&rsquo;t bolted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bolted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;d done something to offend you? My uncle thought you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faxon grasped his arm. &ldquo;Did your uncle send you after me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he gave me an awful rowing for not going up to your room with you
      when you said you were ill. And when we found you&rsquo;d gone we were
      frightened&mdash;and he was awfully upset&mdash;so I said I&rsquo;d catch
      you.... You&rsquo;re <i>not</i> ill, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill? No. Never better.&rdquo; Faxon picked up the lantern. &ldquo;Come; let&rsquo;s go
      back. It was awfully hot in that dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I hoped it was only that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They trudged on in silence for a few minutes; then Faxon questioned:
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too done up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. It&rsquo;s a lot easier with the wind behind us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t talk any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They pushed ahead, walking, in spite of the light that guided them, more
      slowly than Faxon had walked alone into the gale. The fact of his
      companion&rsquo;s stumbling against a drift gave Faxon a pretext for saying:
      &ldquo;Take hold of my arm,&rdquo; and Rainer obeying, gasped out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dance you led me! If it hadn&rsquo;t been for one of the servants
      happening to see you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; all right. And now, won&rsquo;t you kindly shut up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rainer laughed and hung on him. &ldquo;Oh, the cold doesn&rsquo;t hurt me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first few minutes after Rainer had overtaken him, anxiety for the
      lad had been Faxon&rsquo;s only thought. But as each labouring step carried them
      nearer to the spot he had been fleeing, the reasons for his flight grew
      more ominous and more insistent. No, he was not ill, he was not distraught
      and deluded&mdash;he was the instrument singled out to warn and save; and
      here he was, irresistibly driven, dragging the victim back to his doom!
    </p>
    <p>
      The intensity of the conviction had almost checked his steps. But what
      could he do or say? At all costs he must get Rainer out of the cold, into
      the house and into his bed. After that he would act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow-fall was thickening, and as they reached a stretch of the road
      between open fields the wind took them at an angle, lashing their faces
      with barbed thongs. Rainer stopped to take breath, and Faxon felt the
      heavier pressure of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get to the lodge, can&rsquo;t we telephone to the stable for a sleigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re not all asleep at the lodge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll manage. Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; Faxon ordered; and they plodded on....
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the lantern ray showed ruts that curved away from the road under
      tree-darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon&rsquo;s spirits rose. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the gate! We&rsquo;ll be there in five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he caught, above the boundary hedge, the gleam of a light at
      the farther end of the dark avenue. It was the same light that had shone
      on the scene of which every detail was burnt into his brain; and he felt
      again its overpowering reality. No&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t let the boy go back!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at the lodge at last, and Faxon was hammering on the door. He
      said to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him inside first, and make them give him a hot
      drink. Then I&rsquo;ll see&mdash;I&rsquo;ll find an argument....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer to his knocking, and after an interval Rainer said:
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;we&rsquo;d better go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, perfectly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go to the house, I say!&rdquo; Faxon redoubled his blows, and at
      length steps sounded on the stairs. Rainer was leaning against the lintel,
      and as the door opened the light from the hall flashed on his pale face
      and fixed eyes. Faxon caught him by the arm and drew him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was</i> cold out there.&rdquo; he sighed; and then, abruptly, as if
      invisible shears at a single stroke had cut every muscle in his body, he
      swerved, drooped on Faxon&rsquo;s arm, and seemed to sink into nothing at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodge-keeper and Faxon bent over him, and somehow, between them,
      lifted him into the kitchen and laid him on a sofa by the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodge-keeper, stammering: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ring up the house,&rdquo; dashed out of the
      room. But Faxon heard the words without heeding them: omens mattered
      nothing now, beside this woe fulfilled. He knelt down to undo the fur
      collar about Rainer&rsquo;s throat, and as he did so he felt a warm moisture on
      his hands. He held them up, and they were red....

    <p>
      The palms threaded their endless line along the yellow river. The little
      steamer lay at the wharf, and George Faxon, sitting in the verandah of the
      wooden hotel, idly watched the coolies carrying the freight across the
      gang-plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been looking at such scenes for two months. Nearly five had elapsed
      since he had descended from the train at Northridge and strained his eyes
      for the sleigh that was to take him to Weymore: Weymore, which he was
      never to behold!... Part of the interval&mdash;the first part&mdash;was
      still a great grey blur. Even now he could not be quite sure how he had
      got back to Boston, reached the house of a cousin, and been thence
      transferred to a quiet room looking out on snow under bare trees. He
      looked out a long time at the same scene, and finally one day a man he had
      known at Harvard came to see him and invited him to go out on a business
      trip to the Malay Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a bad shake-up, and it&rsquo;ll do you no end of good to get away
      from things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor came the next day it turned out that he knew of the plan
      and approved it. &ldquo;You ought to be quiet for a year. Just loaf and look at
      the landscape,&rdquo; he advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faxon felt the first faint stirrings of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s been the matter with me, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, over-work, I suppose. You must have been bottling up for a bad
      breakdown before you started for New Hampshire last December. And the
      shock of that poor boy&rsquo;s death did the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes&mdash;Rainer had died. He remembered....
    </p>
    <p>
      He started for the East, and gradually, by imperceptible degrees, life
      crept back into his weary bones and leaden brain. His friend was patient
      and considerate, and they travelled slowly and talked little. At first
      Faxon had felt a great shrinking from whatever touched on familiar things.
      He seldom looked at a newspaper and he never opened a letter without a
      contraction of the heart. It was not that he had any special cause for
      apprehension, but merely that a great trail of darkness lay on everything.
      He had looked too deep down into the abyss.... But little by little health
      and energy returned to him, and with them the common promptings of
      curiosity. He was beginning to wonder how the world was going, and when,
      presently, the hotel-keeper told him there were no letters for him in the
      steamer&rsquo;s mail-bag, he felt a distinct sense of disappointment. His friend
      had gone into the jungle on a long excursion, and he was lonely,
      unoccupied and wholesomely bored. He got up and strolled into the stuffy
      reading-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he found a game of dominoes, a mutilated picture-puzzle, some copies
      of <i>Zion&rsquo;s Herald</i> and a pile of New York and London newspapers.

    <p>
      He began to glance through the papers, and was disappointed to find that
      they were less recent than he had hoped. Evidently the last numbers had
      been carried off by luckier travellers. He continued to turn them over,
      picking out the American ones first. These, as it happened, were the
      oldest: they dated back to December and January. To Faxon, however, they
      had all the flavour of novelty, since they covered the precise period
      during which he had virtually ceased to exist. It had never before
      occurred to him to wonder what had happened in the world during that
      interval of obliteration; but now he felt a sudden desire to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prolong the pleasure, he began by sorting the papers chronologically,
      and as he found and spread out the earliest number, the date at the top of
      the page entered into his consciousness like a key slipping into a lock.
      It was the seventeenth of December: the date of the day after his arrival
      at Northridge. He glanced at the first page and read in blazing
      characters: &ldquo;Reported Failure of Opal Cement Company. Lavington&rsquo;s name
      involved. Gigantic Exposure of Corruption Shakes Wall Street to Its
      Foundations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read on, and when he had finished the first paper he turned to the
      next. There was a gap of three days, but the Opal Cement &ldquo;Investigation&rdquo;
       still held the centre of the stage. From its complex revelations of greed
      and ruin his eye wandered to the death notices, and he read: &ldquo;Rainer.
      Suddenly, at Northridge, New Hampshire, Francis John, only son of the
      late....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes clouded, and he dropped the newspaper and sat for a long time
      with his face in his hands. When he looked up again he noticed that his
      gesture had pushed the other papers from the table and scattered them at
      his feet. The uppermost lay spread out before him, and heavily his eyes
      began their search again. &ldquo;John Lavington comes forward with plan for
      reconstructing Company. Offers to put in ten millions of his own&mdash;The
      proposal under consideration by the District Attorney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten millions... ten millions of his own. But if John Lavington was
      ruined?... Faxon stood up with a cry. That was it, then&mdash;that was
      what the warning meant! And if he had not fled from it, dashed wildly away
      from it into the night, he might have broken the spell of iniquity, the
      powers of darkness might not have prevailed! He caught up the pile of
      newspapers and began to glance through each in turn for the head-line:
      &ldquo;Wills Admitted to Probate.&rdquo; In the last of all he found the paragraph he
      sought, and it stared up at him as if with Rainer&rsquo;s dying eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&mdash;<i>that</i> was what he had done! The powers of pity had
      singled him out to warn and save, and he had closed his ears to their
      call, and washed his hands of it, and fled. Washed his hands of it! That
      was the word. It caught him back to the dreadful moment in the lodge when,
      raising himself up from Rainer&rsquo;s side, he had looked at his hands and seen
      that they were red....

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
